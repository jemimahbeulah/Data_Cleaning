You'll learn more about the feedback system in the next step.\n\n## Step 1: Explore the feedback system\n\nEach  exercise lets you test your new skills with a real-world dataset.  Along the way, you'll receive feedback on your work.  You'll see if your answer is right, get customized hints, and see the official solution (_if you'd like to take a look!_).\n\nTo explore the feedback system, we'll start with a simple example of a coding problem.  Follow the following steps in order:\n1. Run the code cell below without making any edits.  It will show the following output: \n> <font color='#ccaa33'>Check:</font> When you've updated the starter code, `check()` will tell you whether your code is correct. You need to update the code that creates variable `one`\n\n    This means you need to change the code to set the variable `one` to something other than the blank provided below (`____`).\n\n\n2. Replace the underline with a `2`, so that the line of code appears as `one = 2`.  Then, run the code cell.  This should return the following output:\n> <font color='#cc3333'>Incorrect:</font> Incorrect value for `one`: `2`\n\n    This means we still have the wrong answer to the question.\n\n\n3. Now, change the `2` to `1`, so that the line of code appears as `one = 1`. Then, run the code cell. The answer should be marked as <font color='#33cc33'>Correct</font>. You have now completed this problem!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"43715642-dcf0-409a-ab6a-4edfee236b2b","_cell_guid":"56f494d4-f75d-4dc4-8761-4f33bffd99c0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fill in the line below\none = 1\n\n# Check your answer\nstep_1.check()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9d61c9be-4d17-47bf-845b-9236917a3174","_cell_guid":"745567c4-7e0b-4e0d-805e-a85eea1b971d","trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this exercise, you were responsible for filling in the line of code that sets the value of variable `one`.  **Don't edit the code that checks your answer.**  You'll need to run the lines of code like `step_1.check()` and `step_2.check()` just as they are provided.\n\nThis problem was relatively straightforward, but for more difficult problems, you may like to receive a hint or view the official solution.
